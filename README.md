# Image Championship
Gradio interface that lets you compare images in a folder, and create a leaderboard of them based on an elo system. Also lets you host it locally to let your friends vote as well.

I made this in like an hour to pick pictures from my cat pictures folder to select the best ones to put on instagram, fun little side project
